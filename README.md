Ness Computing Sequencer Component
==================================

A Sequencer is a data structure which provides a bidirectional mapping
from sparse objects into densely-packed integers.

For example, you may wish to sequence a sparse representation of user IDs
into dense integers to pack efficiently into matrices of floats.
